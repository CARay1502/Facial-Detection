# ðŸ“· Facial Detection System 
This repo is a place for all of my OpenCV projects (facial detection, object detection and computer vision projects) at large. 
It also holds the protype for a MMF Multimedia Framework that I want to develop in response to MSMF's dogshit performance on hardware restricted cameras. 

### Original Project Idea: 
This project is a live face detection web app that streams video from a **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W** to another **Raspberry Pi 5**. Onboard the RP 5, **OpenCV** is utilized to detect, track and record faces of from the video stream.
